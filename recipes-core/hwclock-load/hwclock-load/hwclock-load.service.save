# Note the weird semantics of hwclock and the kernel here: the first
# settimeofday() invocation from userspace is special and may be used
# to set the offset from UTC of the system clock. It is independent
# of any specific RTC device. This is mostly a crufty hack to support
# legacy operating systems which insist on storing local time in the
# RTC.

# Note that we do not run --hctosys here, we assume the kernel
# includes a compiled in RTC module which is used to initialize the
# system time as part of kernel setup.
